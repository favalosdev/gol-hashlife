Very simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

Run `cargo run`and you are done.

- A: Move the camera to the left
- S: Move the camera downwards
- D: Move the camera to the right
- I: Zoom-in
- O: Zoom-out
- P: Pause
- E: Advance the game one generation. Can only be done when the game is paused
- G: Display the grid in which the squares are rendered

You can pause the game and manually set cells as alive by clicking the screen.
